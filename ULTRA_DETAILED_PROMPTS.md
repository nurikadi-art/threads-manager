## IMAGE 1: COMPASS (Priority: CRITICAL)
**Filename:** `compass-navigation.png`
**Aspect Ratio:** 1:1 (1024x1024)

```
SUBJECT:
A vintage brass nautical compass, approximately 80 years old, sitting on a weathered mahogany desk.

SPECIFIC DETAILS:
- The compass body is solid brass with a deep honey-gold patina from decades of handling
- Visible tiny scratches and micro-dents from years of use - not damaged, just lived-in
- The glass crystal has one small chip on the edge (top-right) and faint circular scratches from being opened thousands of times
- The compass rose inside is hand-painted ivory with deep navy blue lettering for N, S, E, W
- The needle is blued steel with a small ruby bearing visible at the pivot point
- Faint verdigris (green oxidation) in the decorative engravings around the edge
- The hinge shows brass-on-brass wear marks from opening and closing

ENVIRONMENT:
- Sitting on a stack of vintage nautical charts, yellowed with age
- The maps have coffee ring stains and pencil annotations in faded handwriting
- One corner of a leather-bound journal visible (dark brown, cracked spine)
- A single brass button from a naval uniform lies nearby
- Dust particles floating in the light beam

CAMERA & LIGHTING:
- Camera: Hasselblad X2D 100C with 80mm f/1.9 lens
- Shot from 45-degree angle above, looking down at the compass
- Shallow depth of field: compass sharp, background charts soft
- Single shaft of warm afternoon light coming from top-left (like through a ship's porthole)
- The light catches the brass, creating a warm glow on the left side
- Right side falls into rich shadow, not black, just deep amber shadow
- Light bounces off the polished glass creating one small specular highlight

COLOR GRADE:
- Warm amber highlights, cool blue-gray shadows
- Overall tone: like a Vermeer painting meets National Geographic
- Muted but rich, not oversaturated

MOOD:
- Quiet contemplation, the weight of important decisions
- This compass has guided someone through storms
- NOT a product photo, NOT a stock image
- This looks like it was photographed in someone's grandfather's study

WHAT TO AVOID:
- No perfect pristine surfaces
- No dramatic HDR look
- No fake bokeh blur
- No obvious AI artifacts or impossible reflections

- One hand on her temple, fingers in her hair
- Other hand hovering over laptop trackpad, frozen mid-scroll

- Handwriting in multiple pen colors, some crossed out
- Printed emails with annotations (some upside down)
- A spiral notebook open to pages of messy notes
- Sticky tabs in a book that's fallen closed
- Phone showing multiple notification badges
- Coffee cup with rings on papers beneath it

- A dead plant (small succulent, brown)

THE CENTER DIVIDE:
- Natural division created by the edge of a laptop screen
- The laptop sits in the middle, creating the split
- Screen shows a clean, organized task management interface

RIGHT SIDE (CLARITY - 45% of frame):
The same desk type/surface, but different area showing organized work:
- Clean notebook with neat handwritten bullets
- Laptop showing organized Notion/task board
- Phone face-down (intentionally silenced)
- Same coffee cup type, but on a coaster
- One quality pen in a holder
- Healthy plant (same type of pot as the dead one)
- Clear desk surface visible
- Small "DONE" checkbox drawn on a Post-it (only one)
- Calm, space to think

SUBTLE VISUAL NARRATIVE:
- This is the same person's desk, same day
- Left is morning, right is after using AI to organize
- The chaos items are real (coffee rings, human mess)

- Realistic office lighting

COLOR GRADE:
- Left side: Slightly chaotic colors, warmer, more cluttered
- Right side: Cooler, cleaner, more breathing room
- The transition is subtle but real
- Documentary style color

MOOD:
- Honest comparison
- The chaos is relatable, not embarrassing
- The clarity is achievable, not aspirational
- Real transformation, not marketing magic

WHAT TO AVOID:
- No split-screen line down the middle
- No dramatic color difference (not gray vs color)
- No impossible organization on the right
- Not a staged product photo

**Filename:** `inbox-2am.png`
**Aspect Ratio:** 16:9 (1920x1080)

- Unsettling, unhealthy

MOOD:
- The founder's insomnia
- "I'll just check quickly"

## IMAGE 16: ANGRY DELIVERY ROBOT (Slide 36)
**Filename:** `angry-delivery-robot.png`
**Aspect Ratio:** 16:9 (1920x1080)

```
SUBJECT:
A malfunctioning delivery robot on a suburban sidewalk, showing clear signs of digital frustration and malfunction.

SPECIFIC DETAILS:
- Medium-sized delivery robot (like those used by Starship/Amazon) approximately 2 feet tall
- LED "face" display showing angry red eyes and a glitching frown expression
- Small sparks visibly flying from one wheel joint
- Steam or smoke wisping from a vent on top
- One compartment door slightly ajar, revealing a crumpled package inside
- Warning lights blinking orange on the sides
- The robot's body has scratches and a dent on one corner from prior mishaps
- Tire treads show signs of uneven wear
- A few loose screws visible near the base

ENVIRONMENT:
- Suburban sidewalk at dusk, street lights just coming on
- Cracked concrete sidewalk with weeds growing through
- A slightly concerned pedestrian visible in the background, blurred
- One knocked-over trash can nearby (implied the robot hit it)
- Fallen autumn leaves scattered around the robot
- A house porch with warm lights visible in the background
- Mailbox with "WRONG ADDRESS" visible on a return label stuck to it

CAMERA & LIGHTING:
- Camera: Sony A7R V with 35mm f/1.4 lens
- Eye-level shot, slightly below the robot to give it menacing presence
- Shallow depth of field: robot sharp, background suburban scene soft
- Dramatic golden hour light from the left (setting sun)
- The robot's LED face creates harsh red glow on the sidewalk below
- Warning lights create orange color splashes
- Cool blue shadows on the right side contrasting the warm light

COLOR GRADE:
- Warm amber sunset tones meeting cool electronic blues and angry reds
- Cinematic contrast, not overprocessed
- Slightly desaturated except for the robot's warning lights

MOOD:
- Ominous, slightly humorous technology rebellion
- This robot has had ENOUGH
- The calm suburban setting contrasts with the robot's digital rage
- Captures the moment before something goes wrong

WHAT TO AVOID:
- Don't make the robot look cute or friendly
- No cartoon expressions
- No clean/pristine robot - it should show wear and malfunction
- No daytime bright lighting - needs the dramatic dusk atmosphere

## IMAGE 17: JUGGLING TORCHES - AI HIGH MAINTENANCE (Slide 39)
**Filename:** `ai-juggling-torches.png`
**Aspect Ratio:** 16:9 (1920x1080)

```
SUBJECT:
A stressed business professional desperately trying to juggle multiple flaming torches in an office environment, each flame labeled or associated with AI icons/symbols.

SPECIFIC DETAILS:
- Professional in business casual (rolled-up sleeves, loosened tie)
- Age 35-45, showing visible stress (sweat on brow, wide eyes, clenched jaw)
- Juggling 5-6 flaming torches in various positions mid-air
- Each torch flame has a subtle digital/pixelated quality at the edges
- Small floating icons near each flame: robot head, chat bubble, brain icon, gear, warning triangle
- The person's hands are slightly blurred from frantic motion
- Expression is overwhelmed but determined - this isn't fun, it's survival
- Slight singeing visible on one shirt sleeve
- One torch is clearly about to fall (captured mid-drop trajectory)

ENVIRONMENT:
- Modern open-plan office at night (lights on inside, dark windows)
- Multiple computer monitors in the background showing various AI interfaces and dashboards
- Sticky notes and papers scattered on desk and floor
- Coffee cups (multiple) visible - some empty, some tipped over
- A fire extinguisher visible in the corner (ironic detail)
- Whiteboard in background with "AI TASKS" written and many items checked off with more being added
- Clock on wall showing 11:45 PM

CAMERA & LIGHTING:
- Camera: Canon EOS R5 with 24-70mm f/2.8 at 35mm
- Dynamic low angle shot to emphasize the drama and height of the torches
- Fast shutter capture to freeze the motion with slight intentional blur on the moving torches
- Main light from the flames themselves - warm orange/yellow illuminating the face from above
- Blue-ish office fluorescent lighting in background creates contrast
- Each torch casts dancing shadows on the ceiling
- Dramatic chiaroscuro effect on the subject's face

COLOR GRADE:
- Warm fire tones (orange, yellow, gold) dominating the upper frame
- Cool office blues and grays in the lower frame and background
- High contrast, cinematic look
- The flames should feel dangerous and real

MOOD:
- Overwhelming chaos that's JUST barely under control
- The viewer should feel anxiety looking at this
- Visual metaphor for AI management being exhausting
- NOT a failure moment - this person is MANAGING, but barely
- Professional competence meeting its limit

ARROWS/LABELS:
- Subtle digital-style arrows pointing from some flames with small text labels:
  - "GPT-4" near one flame
  - "Claude" near another
  - "Automation" near a third
- These should be semi-transparent, like HUD overlays, not distracting from the photo

WHAT TO AVOID:
- Don't make it look like a circus act - this is an OFFICE
- No smile or enjoyment - this is stress
- No cartoonish flames - realistic fire
- Don't make the AI icons too prominent - they're subtle overlays
- No actual burns or injury - just near-misses and stress
